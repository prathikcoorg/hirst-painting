# hirst-painting


This Python project recreates Damien Hirst's iconic dot paintings using Turtle Graphics. It extracts a palette of colors from an image file using the colorgram library. The Turtle module then paints a grid of evenly spaced, randomly colored dots on the canvas. The result is a vibrant, algorithmic artwork inspired by Hirst's style.
